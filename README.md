Installing and running instructions:
Frontend:

Backend:
You need a Mongo.db Atlas account, you can make one on their site.
After you made your account, create a cluster, and press connect, select driver,
then on the screen will be a link that you will copy and paste it the backend in src/util/contants.ts in the MONGO_URL constant
then to start the server you need these commands:
npm install
